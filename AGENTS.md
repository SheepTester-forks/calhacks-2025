# Agent Instructions

- Run `npm run format` to format all the files before committing.
- This is a hackathon project, so the goal is to integrate as many of the prizes (except for low quality ones) listed in `Docs/Prizes.md` as possible.
- If you add any `console.log` statements while debugging, please leave them in so I can use them too for debugging.
