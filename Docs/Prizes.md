 - Query Planner Challenge - AppLovin: Every day, more than 1.6 billion people in the world will see an AppLovin ad â€“ which means behind the scenes, weâ€™re processing and optimizing against massive volumes of data. Impressions, installs, purchases, bids â€“ all of it needs to be queried, aggregated, and analyzed across numerous dimensions, fast.  Turn raw event data into lightning-fast insights, showing not only that your system runs quickly, but that its query planning and physical design choices are sound. Anything goes â€” DB restructuring, aggregations, intelligent query planning, indexes, caching layers â€” as long as it all runs self-contained (without network access to 3rd parties) The judges will run your solution on a separate set of queries. They will be of the same type of queries you have done your benchmark against. Judges will be running on a MacBook M2 with Apple Silicon, meaning your solution cannot require more than 16 GB RAM or 100 GB Disk usage
 - Ad Intelligence Challenge - AppLovin: At the core of AppLovinâ€™s Axon technology is a real-time recommendation system that processes thousands of features about users, advertisers, and the ads they see â€” all to predict which creative, at this very moment, will drive the best result. This challenge is about diving into that foundation: how can we extract smarter, more meaningful signals from ad creatives themselves? Create a model or prototype that processes ad creatives (images or videos) and extracts novel, high-value features or insights that could feed into a recommendation engine. Examples may include:  Tone or emotional sentiment Type of product or content being advertised Text, logo, or object recognition Audio or visual embeddings Any other creative or contextual signals that could inform ad performance prediction  What Weâ€™re Looking For: Signal Extraction Insight Ability to extract diverse high value signals from an ad creatives Signals should be distinct and minimally overlapping Clear justification for why these signals could improve a recommendation or ranking model
