# Next Steps for AdSim

This document outlines the next steps for developing the AdSim platform.

## 1. Configure API Keys

To enable the full functionality of the application, you need to obtain API keys for the following services and add them to the `.env.local` file:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_REKA_API_KEY`: [Reka](https://reka.ai/)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLAUDE_API_KEY`: [Anthropic (Claude)](https://www.anthropic.com/claude)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_JANITOR_API_KEY`: [Janitor AI](https://janitorai.com/)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FETCH_API_KEY`: [Fetch.ai](https://fetch.ai/)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_API_KEY`: [LiveKit](https://livekit.io/)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`: [LiveKit](https://livekit.io/)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FISH_AUDIO_API_KEY`: [Fish Audio](https://www.fish.audio/)

## 2. Implement Real API Calls

The current implementation uses mock data and simulated API calls. The next step is to replace the mock implementations in the `src/services` directory with real API calls to the respective services.

- `src/services/reka.ts`: Implement the ad analysis using the Reka API.
- `src/services/claude.ts`: Implement persona response generation using the Claude API.
- `src/services/janitor.ts`: Implement the multiplayer chat experience using the Janitor AI API.
- `src/services/fetch.ts`: Register and manage the AI personas as autonomous agents on the Fetch.ai Agentverse.
- `src/services/livekit.ts`: Implement real-time voice and video communication using the LiveKit SDK.
- `src/services/fish_audio.ts`: (After creating the file) Implement text-to-speech for the AI personas using the Fish Audio API.

## 3. Build Out the UI

The current UI is basic and can be improved. Here are some suggestions:

- **Dashboard:** Create a more visually appealing and informative dashboard for the ad analysis results. Consider using charts and graphs to visualize the data.
- **Interactive Chat:** Allow the user to interact with the AI personas by asking follow-up questions.
- **Voice Integration:** Integrate the LiveKit and Fish Audio services to enable voice chat with the AI personas.

## 4. Add User Authentication

Implement a user authentication system to allow users to save their ad analysis results and manage their projects.

## 5. Deploy to Vercel

The project is set up to be easily deployed to Vercel. Once the API keys are configured, you can deploy the application to share it with others.
