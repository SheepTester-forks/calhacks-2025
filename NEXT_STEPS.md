# Next Steps for AdSim

This document outlines the next steps for developing the AdSim platform, based on the prioritized list of features and prizes in `prizes_ranked.md`.

## 1. Implement Tier 1 Features (Core Functionality)

The immediate priority is to build the core functionality of the AdSim platform. This involves the following tasks:

- **Configure API Keys:** Obtain API keys for Reka, Claude, and Janitor AI and add them to the `.env.local` file.
- **Implement Real API Calls:**
  - `src/services/reka.ts`: Implement ad analysis using the Reka API.
  - `src/services/claude.ts`: Implement persona response generation using the Claude API.
  - `src/services/janitor.ts`: Implement the multiplayer chat experience using the Janitor AI API.
- **Build the Basic UI:** Create the initial user interface for uploading ads and viewing the simulated audience chat.

## 2. Implement Tier 2 Features (High-Impact Enhancements)

Once the core functionality is in place, we can move on to the high-impact enhancements. These are stretch goals that will significantly improve the platform.

- **Integrate Fish Audio:**
  - `src/services/fish_audio.ts`: Implement text-to-speech for the AI personas using the Fish Audio API.
  - **UI:** Add controls to enable and disable voice generation.
- **Build the Data Visualization Dashboard:**
  - Use a library like Chart.js or D3.js to create a visually appealing dashboard for the ad analysis results.
  - This addresses the **Warp** prize.
- **Focus on Design and Usability:**
  - Refine the UI/UX to make the platform intuitive and easy to use.
  - This addresses the **Creao** prizes.

## 3. Implement Tier 3 Features (Supporting Features)

These features can be implemented if time permits.

- **Workflow Automations:** Use Composio and Postman to create integrations with external tools like Slack and Jira.
- **Explore Additional Models:** Investigate using open-source models (Annapurna) or other LLM providers (Lava) for specialized tasks.

## 4. General Tasks

- **User Authentication:** Implement a user authentication system to allow users to save their projects.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the application to Vercel for sharing and testing.
